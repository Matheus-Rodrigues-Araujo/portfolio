                            <p>React.js is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it allows you to create reusable and interactive components, which are responsible for rendering only the parts of the page that need to be updated, resulting in a more efficient and responsive user experience.</p>

                            <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language used to define the look and layout of elements on a web page. It works in conjunction with HTML to determine how elements should be displayed and formatted.</p>

                            <p>A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for creating web services that follows REST principles. REST is a set of guidelines and standards that define how a system's resources should be exposed and manipulated over the internet.</p>
                             <p>A RESTful API is based on the proper use of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to perform operations on resources. Each resource is identified by a unique URL (endpoint) and can be accessed through these HTTP requests.</p>
