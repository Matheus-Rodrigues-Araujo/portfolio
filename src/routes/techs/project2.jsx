                            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the web. It is a fundamental language for the development of web pages and is interpreted by browsers to display content in a formatted and interactive way.</p>

                            <h3>CSS</h3>
                            <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language used to define the look and layout of elements on a web page. It works in conjunction with HTML to determine how elements should be displayed and formatted.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Javascript</h3>
                            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. Originally developed to run in the web browser, it has become one of the most popular and widely used languages in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
                             <p>It is a dynamic language, which means that changes can be made during program execution without the need for recompilation. It supports asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking operations to be performed, which is particularly useful in web applications.</p>
